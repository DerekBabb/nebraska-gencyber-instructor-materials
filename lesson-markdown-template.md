### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson
 (delete this line and all bullets that do not apply )

* __Abstraction__: An abstraction is a representation of an object or concept. The gauges in an automobile are an abstraction of the performance of a car. A map is an abstraction of the earth. Abstraction allows us to model an object without considering all of the (possibly infinite) complexity that the object may contain. In this lesson, we use abstraction to model data structures similarly as we did in lesson one.

* __Domain Separation__: Good fences make good neighbors. When trying to secure a home or computer, separating the areas where resources are and people work prevents accidents and loss of data or private information. We are preventing the information worlds from colliding. In this lesson, we apply this principle to managing distinct sets of resources by seperating them with a virtual fence in a 'virtual machine.'

* __Information Hiding__: Information hiding is any attempt to prevent people from being able to see information. It can be hiding the content of a letter, or it can be applied to hiding how the letter is delivered. Both ways can prevent people from being able to see the information. This lesson looks at how information can be rendered **meaningless** for eavesdroppers using cryptography.

* __Layering__: Cyber security uses multiple layers of defense or protecting information. If one layer is defeated the next layer should catch it. This lesson emphasizes the human element, that is we as humans have to catch problems (like phishing) that make it past the email-level and browser-level filtering mechanisms.

* __Least Privilege__: One of the ways to protect information is by limiting what people can see and do with your information and resources.

* __Minimization__: Minimization refers to having the least functionality necessary in a program or device. The goal of minimization is to simplify and decrease the number of ways that software can be exploited. This can include **turning off ports that are not needed**, reducing the amount of code running on a machine, and/or turning off unneeded features in an application. This lesson focuses specifically on turning off ports that aren't in use.

* __Modularization__: The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.

* __Process Isolation__: A process is when a program is run. By keeping processes separated, it prevents the failure of one process from causing another to fail. Virtual machines isolate processes running inside them from those running elsewhere on a computer. This allows users to do many dangerous tasks (such as malware analysis) with little or no risk of harm outside of the virtual machine.

* __Resource Encapsulation__: A resource can be hardware such as memory, disk drives, or a display screen. It can also be system objects such as semaphores, a linked list, or shared memory. Processes (or programs) need resources to run. Resources have to be separated and used in the way they were intended. Virtual machines encapsulate an operating system and all of the processes and applications it contains.

* __Simplicity__: Simplicity allows a person to better understand hardware and software. Without the clutter of unnecessarily complicated code and interfaces, the software will be more understandable by people that will update the code when requirements change. It will be easier to understand by the testers and they will be able to spot problems sooner. By keeping software as simple and as focused as possible, the reliability and security is greatly increased.
